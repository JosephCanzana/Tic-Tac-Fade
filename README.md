# Tic-Tac-Fade
#### Video Demo:  <TODO>
## üìù Description:

&emsp;We all know and love **Tic-Tac-Toe** however we also know it's flaw - it can be repetitive and unfair, especially when first player (X typically first move) knows a perfect strategy to win everytime. 

&emsp;In this project, I present a twist on Tic-Tac-Toe, a concept inspired of **Tic-Tac-Bolt**, and I named it **`Tic-Tac-Fade`**. A variation where players can only have three active moves at the board. When the fourth move is next the oldest move will fade it's opacity, then after deciding on a move faded move will disappear. By doing this we can keep the game dynamic and strategic.

## üéÆ Game mechanics description:
- Classic 3√ó3 Tic Tac Toe with a slight variation.
- But instead of just marking and ending when someone gets 3, each player can only have 3 active moves on the board at any time.
- When a player places a 4th move, their oldest move fades away, and the square becomes free again.
- The same rule applies to both X and O.
- You can‚Äôt place a new move on your own faded square again until it‚Äôs free.

This approach prevents stale, repetitive strategies and keeps the gameplay fresh.

## üõ†Ô∏è Why Pygame?
&emsp;The project primarily use the library of **`pygame-ce`**, it is same as pygame but a more maintained version of it. Moreover before choosing the pygame there's another option which is **`tk`**. Since I'm familiar with java swing, tk would be easier to work with, however since it's nice learn new things, I chose pygame.

## üóÉÔ∏è File and Class Overview
- **`project.py`** - The main entry point of the program. It manages the overall game state, event loop, and user interface rendering.
- **`panel.py`** - A layout and panel management module inspired by Java Swing-style placement. It handles responsive positioning and sizing of UI elements.
- **`play_area.py`** - Contains the logic for the game board and player interactions. It manages the 3x3 grid, move placement, win checking, and the fading mechanic that limits each player to 3 active moves.
- **`my_color.py`** - Color definitions for the game. This file stores and manages all color values used to maintain a consistent and visually appealing design.
- **`test_project.py`** - Testing custom function logic from the main project code.
